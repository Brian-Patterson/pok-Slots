I am making a slot game. All the user has to do is select amount of money to bet, then press play button

The user should see three buttons to select amount to bet. There will be a legend explaining the bets and the returns from 
matching different symbols. The user see their current amount of money, and when ready, will be able to press a clearly diffined play button.

WELCOME TO POKESLOTS!!!!!

You can play for free, but if you want to make money, you'll need to select a bet. 

Betting 1 will make you win if you get three matching pictures across the middle row. 

Betting 2 will make you win if you get three matching pictures across the middle row AND both top and bottom rows too. 

Betting 3 will make you win if you get three matching pictures across the middle row AND both top and bottom rows AND diagonaly in both directions.
